I've been part of the web industry since 2004, working across many sectors on projects of all sizes, variously as a lead developer in fast-paced London ad agencies, as part of internal agile teams in technology companies and more recently as a freelancer and consultant. I've worked for clients such as Sony, BP, PwC, EE, ASOS, Sainbury's, Phillip Morris USA, Diageo, and Burberry.

I specialise in application architecture, the JavaScript ecosystem, agile working, project specification and planning, testing, automation and web-related devops. I engage frequently with the open source community, maintain projects that have seen >20K downloads per month on npm and have deep experience with the web platform - including TypeScript, ES2015+, Babel, Webpack, ASTs, Node, React, React Native, Redux, Angular, Docker, REST, GraphQL, UI component methodologies, HTML, CSS and CSS-in-JS. I'm comfortable with highly technical tasks and more creative/UX related work.

I've been working almost exclusively remotely since around 2013, and know how to be highly productive and drive projects forward as part of a distributed team.
