Working to evolve [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com) with a focus on the Sketch web app, the developer platform and the JavaScript ecosystem.

Sketch is an Apple Design Award winning digital design platform built to help you create your best work â€” from early ideas, through to final assets.

> I've been part of the web industry since 2004, working across many sectors on projects of all sizes, variously as a lead developer in fast-paced London ad agencies, as part of internal agile teams in technology companies and more recently as a freelancer and consultant. I've worked for clients such as Sony, BP, PwC, EE, ASOS, Sainbury's, Phillip Morris USA, Diageo, and Burberry.
>
> I specialise in application architecture, the JavaScript ecosystem, agile working, project specification and planning, testing, automation and web-related devops. I engage frequently with the open source community, maintain projects that have seen >20K downloads per month on npm and have deep experience with the web platform - including TypeScript, ES2015+, Babel, Webpack, ASTs, Node, React, React Native, Redux, Angular, Docker, REST, GraphQL, UI component methodologies, HTML, CSS and CSS-in-JS. I'm comfortable with highly technical tasks and more creative/UX related work.
> 
> I've been working almost exclusively remotely since around 2013, and know how to be highly productive and drive projects forward as part of a distributed team.
